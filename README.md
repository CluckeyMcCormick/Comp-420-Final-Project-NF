# Comp 420 Final Project (NF)
My personal copy of the final project I did in Comp 420 (Databases). [Forrest Tappan](https://github.com/forresttappan281?tab=overview&from=2016-04-28) and I worked together to create a MySQL superhero database.

If you wish to look at the database for yourself, there is an SQL file located in the sqls folder called **herodb_complete_init.sql**. This creates all the tables, procedures, and views. It also inserts all the data that was used to populate the database. All you need to do is create the databse the SQL file uses - in this case 'HeroDB'. That's line 2 of the file, if you wish to edit it.

All the other SQL files are just pieces of **herodb_complete_init.sql**. Most of the work on the database was done in class using the MySQL client. This made it rather convenient to edit multiple files, but inconvenient to run those multiple files to build the database. Thus we have the ultra query - built from all the other queries to ease the building of the database.
